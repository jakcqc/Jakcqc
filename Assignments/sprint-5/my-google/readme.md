This is my google app SSOFlaskApp

You need to set up a virtual environment using the command 

virtualenv --python=python3 'location'

then you will go into the bin or Scripts folder of this location and run 

source activate

now you will cd back into the original 13 example folder with python app.py 

You will then run python app.py and copy the uri into your web browser and use the app
