My biggest challenge with this app was understanding how these apps are then edited and created by a user that is working with them. With dex, certain commands to actually set it up were based on a Linux operating system. Which based on an ec2 unix/linux server this was apparent. I figured out how to set it up after downloading the windows 10 subsystem of linux and running the commands. After understanding what my computer was actually doing I moved on to flask. I was able to get this to work perfectly and will be implementing this on a personal app I am working on, hopefully. By the end of the semester My app will hopefully be hosted on my own website instead of locally ran through a virtual environment.
