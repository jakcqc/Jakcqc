This application's main audience will be any user who needs access to google accounts for their application. What this means is instead of having my own database of accounts, and information, I can use a secure google account.  The intention of this app would be to allow a website the ability to expand on the functionality of its content, and not the backend of secure accounts for users. For example, My other website uses accounts linked to my own database, which is not as secure as google's.
