My project is a web based app using sails.js. It uses the default homepage with some different stylings.

I chose sails as it was easy to work with, and im familiar with bootstrap and webased clients.

I got it to work all the way, in the sense that I lifted my app and the sso part of the app works.

The obstacles I erncountered where using Sails documentation to actually use this app. The documentation is not very good on their website, but youtube helped out a lot. Also, the mvc setup they have on their app is counter intuitive to the html, css, js, dynamic and their where a lot of confusing page setups and templates that made modification weird.
