"The desire to give a present to the programmer community." This is the line that stood out to me in each of the articles. I have always found the CS community to be very close knit, and this is just more proof to it. Open source is based on the idea of giving and allowing more people to create, which is what CS is all about. Altruism as well is based along this same line of helping out those in the same field. I participate in open source for the same reason: I want people to see what I am making and create something bigger and better with their help. Regardless of the lower cost, and more people, etc, open source is way a to create and make better software for everyone.
