I would use an Apache 2.0 and MIT license for my open source. 
I would use MIT license as it has almost no restrictions for reuse and would allow many people to use my software. And anyone who uses my software has to follow the suite of MIT license.
The Apache license Version 2.0 is nice as any possiblity of suing for royalties or patents. This would give my okpen source the ability to be freely distributed and used wuithout fear of the law getting involved over infringing patents.
