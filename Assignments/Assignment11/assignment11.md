I plan to participate in the evolution working group call on April the 8th.
The change from an indie developer and team, to everything have money from a huge company is definetely something I have noticed from old software that struggled to keep up with changes.  It is a bit naive that these projects are always making the world a better place, but it is sad to see how corporate interest has potentially killed several new projects.
